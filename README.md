# rideshareroutes

A simple POC for a system to add stops, riders, and rideshares for a dynamic route implementation where stops can be any geolocation (independent of physical infrastructure) and "buses" can be any vehicle.

This is a concept for implementing buses and public transportation in either areas that lack the infrastructure OR in areas of dense populations but still motor vehicle based transportation primarily. All the while, stops can be anywhere but drop offs and pick ups should be ideally a minimal walking distance for riders and also not too out of the way from a "Backbone" route that the drivers have their deviation stops based off of (for example, main streets and popular locations and corners).
